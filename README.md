# HOW TO INSTALL
● 1. Install the Discord Desktop App, then the Vencord mod for it. (Not compatible with BetterDiscord for now!)<br>
● 2. Once on Vencord, go into Settings > Plugins, and enable the "ThemeAttributes" plugin, then restart the app.<br>
● 3. Download <a href="https://github.com/PraskaLukestiwa/discord-momotalk-dark/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">MomotalkSource.theme.css</a><br>
● 4. Go into Settings > Themes > Open Themes folder, and put MomotalkSource.theme.css into themes folder<br>
● 5. On Discord, press the "Load Missing Themes" button, and enable it!<br>
● 6. Alternatively, instead downloading the theme, you can put this link to Online Themes: <pre>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PraskaLukestiwa/discord-momotalk-dark/main/MomotalkSource.theme.css</pre><br>
